## Welcome to Project Outreach

Outreach is a platform that strengthens the bond between immigrant parents and teachers to help students succeed. 

### What is it about?

Problem Space: Immigrant Populations and Education

Problem Statement: How do we connect low income immigrant parents and academic institutions in the greater Seattle area, so that it raises parents’ awareness on their children’s (7-8th grade) school life, which would help their children advance academically?

Our focus as a collective is to help defy the barriers immigrant populations face in front of mobility. Life for the children of immigrant households is extremely hard given that they face language, financial, and cultural barriers. In order to alleviate this tension created between the poor communicaiton between institutions and immigrant populations, we hope to create a solution which breaks these barriers and creates a thriving environment for immigrant students.
